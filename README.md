## What you can do with the Rover using the console
First, open your browser's developer tools. Go to the console.
You can access to the current Rovers using the command `Game.rovers`.<br>
You can access to the map using the command `Game.map`.<br>
You can access to the cameras using the command `Game.cameras`.<br>
You can perform the next actions:<br>

- Create a new Rover: `Game.map.addRover(id, preset)` where id is a number different of 0 and 1 (because de default Rover has an id of 1), and preset is a string (`'primary'` to use the arrow keys to move the rover and `'secondary'` to use WASD keys).
- Move forward: `Game.rovers[id].moveForward();`
- Move backward: `Game.rovers[id].moveBackward();`
- Turn right: `Game.rovers[id].turnRight();`
- Turn left: `Game.rovers[id].turnLeft();`
- Prepare movements: `Game.rovers[id].prepareMoves(list)` Where list is a string with the next valid movements: `f b r l`

Example: To prepare your rover to go forward, forward, right, backward, left, left you enter into console: `Game.rovers[0].prepareMoves('ffrbll')`

If you put an invalid movement, the rover will stay on the same site. 

Change 'id' with the index of the Rover you want to move.<br>
If you go beyond the limits of the map, or there is another obstacle, you will get an error.<br>
