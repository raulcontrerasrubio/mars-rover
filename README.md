# mars-rover
This is a project from Ironhack's prework Javascript module

## How to test the project
1. Go to the [Demo page](https://raulcontrerasrubio.github.io/mars-rover/)
2. Open your browser's developer tools. Go to the Console.
3. Create a Rover writing in console: `var rover = new Rover(id);` where id is a number different of 0.
4. Now you can access to the Rover's properties and methods. These are explained in the next section.

## What can you do with the Rover
Once you have created the Rover, you can access to different properties.<br>
Write in the command line the next sentences:<br>

- Access to the Rover object: `rover`
- Move forward: `rover.moveForward();`
- Move backward: `rover.moveBackward();`
- Turn right: `rover.turnRight();`
- Turn left: `rover.turnLeft();`

If you go beyond the limits of the map (10x10), or there is another obstacle, you will get an error.
